# [JSL09] Submission: Personal Dashboard Chrome Extension

## Overview:
In this project, I was required to generate a background image that displays Time, Weather and the Dogecoin live. Every background displayed should also include the name of the owner of that background.

## Technologies used:
To complete this project, I was following tutorial videos on Scrimba.
This project includes technologies such as html,css,javascript,manifesto and an icon image.

## Feedback:
I enjoyed completing this project because it was filled with new features that I did not know how to execute(but now I know). This was a very fun experience.

## What I learned: 
What interested me the most in the project is the fact that I was able to display the weather forecast of my location LIVE and the time as well. This is a feature that interested me a lot.

## Challenges:
I experienced no challenges so far. Although going through this work again and doing more research about these features is what I'm gonna do!
